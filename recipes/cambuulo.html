    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cambuulo is a traditional Somali dish made with red adzuki beans. It’s a versatile meal, often enjoyed as both a dinner and a dessert, depending on how it’s prepared. In this version, the beans are cooked with butter and sugar, giving them a sweet flavor. Though simple in ingredients, Cambuulo’s slow cooking method allows the beans to develop a rich texture that pairs well with the sweetness of the sugar and butter.</p>
